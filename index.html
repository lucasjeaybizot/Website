    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h3>Initially from France, I have lived, studied, and worked across the globe, from Australia to Scotland, through Austria to California.</h3>
    <p>I am a PhD candidate in Computational and Data Sciences at Chapman University. My research innvestigates how decisions are made in the absence of constraints with a particular focus on the relationship between brain activity and the timing of a decision.</p>
    <p>I primarily use electroencephalography (EEG) to record the brain's electrical activity over time at a set of locations across the scalp and a variety of machine learning approaches to predict decisions from the brain's timeseries data.</p>
    <p>Over the course of my training I got to work with other techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and topics such as how one regulates their emotions or even how frog territoriality increases fitness.</p>

    <h1>What is this website for?</h1>
    <h3>And for whom?</h3>
    <p>This website acts as an extension to my resume and is designed for anyone who wants to keep up with the research I am pursuing or for those curious about my background and experience.</p>
    <p><a href="index.html">Home</a> is the tab you are currently on. <a href="research_page.html">Research</a> provides an overview of the research I have and am currently conducting. <a href="education_page.html">Education</a> provides an overview of my educational journey and related trainings. <a href="blog_page.html">Blog</a> is a tab where I document non-research related topics of interest and exemplifies different skills.</p>
